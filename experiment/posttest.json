                "a": "Correlation can help in identifying the relationship between features.",
                "b": "Highly correlated features may provide redundant information.",
                "c": "Correlation can affect the shape and orientation of the feature space.",

                "a": "While true, it is not the complete effect of correlation.",

            "answers": {
                "a": "Yes, due to the curse of dimensionality.",
                "b": "No, more features always improve accuracy.",
                "c": "Yes, because new features can add noise.",

                "a": "Adding new features can increase the dimensionality, which may dilute the effectiveness of each feature.",
                "b": "This is incorrect; more features can sometimes reduce accuracy.",
                "c": "Adding new features can add noise, but the main issue is the curse of dimensionality.",
                "d": "This is incorrect; adding features can change accuracy."

            "answers": {
                "a": "Yes, scaling features helps to ensure each feature contributes equally.",
                "b": "No, scaling features does not impact NN classifiers.",
                "c": "Yes, because unscaled features can dominate the distance calculation.",

                "a": "Scaling ensures that each feature contributes equally to the distance metric.",
                "b": "This is incorrect; scaling can significantly impact distance calculations.",
                "c": "Unscaled features can dominate the distance calculation, but scaling helps.",
                "d": "Generally, scaling is preferred, making this a less common case."

Is it possible to do so if you have a function that takes in two feature vectors (possibly of different lengths), and outputs the similarity/distance between them? Suggest a possible function of this nature, and a classification problem, where it can be applied.",
            "answers": {
                "a": "Yes, by using a custom distance function like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).",
                "b": "No, all feature vectors must be of the same length.",
                "c": "Yes, by padding shorter vectors with zeros.",

            "explanations": {
                "a": "DTW can handle varying lengths by finding the optimal alignment between feature vectors.",
                "b": "This is incorrect; custom distance functions can handle different lengths.",
                "c": "Padding is a solution but not as effective as using custom distance functions.",
