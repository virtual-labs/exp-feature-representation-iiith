# Experiment Instructions

Welcome to the Pattern Recognition Experiment. In this simulation, your objective is to identify the most effective features for classifying datasets characterized by two digits. Follow the stages below to understand the process and achieve the target accuracy for each dataset.

## **Stage 1: Initial Exploration**

1. **Load Dataset:**
   - Select a dataset from the available list. Each dataset represents a pair of digits (e.g., 0-1, 3-8, 5-6, 1-3).

2. **Select Features:**
   - Choose the first two features from the dropdown menus. These features will be used to create a 2D feature space representation.

3. **Visualize Data:**
   - Display the samples in a 2D feature space. This scatter plot will help you visualize the distribution of the data points based on the selected features.

4. **Check Accuracy:**
   - The simulation automatically evaluates the accuracy of the nearest neighbor (NN) classifier for the chosen features.

5. **Aim for Target Accuracy:**
   - Note the target accuracy for the dataset. Your goal is to modify the selected features to achieve or surpass this target accuracy. Use the descriptions provided by hovering over each feature in the table to understand their characteristics.

## **Stage 2: Iterative Improvement**

1. **Explore Different Datasets:**
   - Repeat the procedure for each dataset provided in the experiment. For each dataset, identify the features that lead to the highest classification accuracy.

2. **Experiment with Feature Combinations:**
   - Plot different features to understand their behavior and impact on classification accuracy.

3. **Evaluate Current and Maximum Accuracy:**
   - Use the current accuracy displayed to assess the effectiveness of your chosen features. The maximum accuracy indicates the performance of the best feature pair available.

4. **Identify and Analyze Outliers:**
   - Observe any outliers in the clusters on the scatter plot. Hover over these outliers to see the image and understand why it might be an outlier. Analyzing the shape and peculiarities of these images can provide insights into the feature selection and its impact on classification accuracy.

## **Additional Features of the Simulation**

- **Feature Descriptions:**
  - Hover over each feature in the table to view a detailed description of what each feature represents. This will help you understand the significance of each feature.

- **Data Point Details:**
  - Hover over each dot on the scatterplot to see the corresponding image and exact feature values. This visualization aids in comprehending the distribution and characteristics of the data points.

- **Image Zoom:**
  - Click on the images in the table to view a zoomed-in version. This allows for a closer inspection of the digit representations.

Your objective throughout this experiment is to strategically select and combine features to achieve the target accuracy for each dataset, ultimately demonstrating an effective feature space representation for digit classification. Maintain an analytical approach as you explore, evaluate, and refine your feature selections.
