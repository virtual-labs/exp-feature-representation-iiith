# Experiment Instructions

Welcome to the Pattern Recognition Experiment. In this simulation, your objective is to identify the most effective features for classifying datasets characterized by two digits. Follow the stages below to understand the process and achieve the target accuracy for each dataset.

## Steps
- Select or generate data points with features and labels.
- Visualize them in 2D space.
- Run k-NN on the data and classify a test point.
- Observe classification changes with different features or scaling.
